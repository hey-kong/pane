Here's the normal chats of Abigail with the player:
Regular
First Meeting
“	“Oh that's right...I heard someone new was moving onto that old farm.
It's kind of a shame, really. I always enjoyed exploring those overgrown fields by myself.”

Regular
“	“Oh, hey. Taking a break from work?”
“	“Oh, hi! Do you ever hang out at the cemetery? It's a peaceful place to spend some time alone.”
“	“Ugh... I'm not in a good mood right now.
I said I'm not in a good mood... what do you want?”

“	“...*sigh*... I know my parents mean well, but sometimes they just cannot understand my point of view. Weren't they ever young?”
“	“Hey. Sorry in advance if I say anything rude. I didn't get much sleep last night. What do you want?”
“	“Oh no, I think my Dad's going to cook dinner tonight... I don't feel like doing anything today...”
“	“The fresh mountain air is nice on a day like this. I wonder if the frogs will make an appearance soon.”
“	“Oh, hi [Player]. Taking a break from your work? Me too. Oh! Nothing physical... just some online classes I'm taking.”
“	“Hi, I'm glad to see you. I want to take my mind off things for a while... how is your day going?”
Fridays:
“	“Wow, I just realized it's Friday. Sometimes I totally lose track of time.”
“	“We're all going to hang out in the saloon this evening. It's kind of like a Friday tradition, I guess.”
Sundays:
“	“Oh man... I've been pushing off my homework all weekend. Looks like I'll be pulling another all-nighter...”
When the townsfolk are using the altar room
“	“We're hiding in here so we don't have to talk to anyone”
If sold low quality crops to Pierre
“	“Hey. We had one of those [items] you sold at the shop for dinner last night... I guess it was starting to go bad and my Dad couldn't bear to throw it out. Unfortunately it tasted like [adjective].”
If sold high quality crops to Pierre
“	“Hey. We had one of those [items] you sold at the shop for dinner last night... I guess it was starting to go bad and my Dad couldn't bear to throw it out. It was still pretty good, though.”
6+ Hearts
“	“You came all this way to visit me? That's nice. So have you been exploring the mountain caves at all? Interesting. I'd like to go there myself one of these days.”
“	“The birds were happily chirping today. They're too simple to understand the future.
It's better to be like them, isn't it?”

8+ Hearts
“	“...Oh, [Player]! Hi. Want to hang out for a while? Here! Let me read your palm. *giggle* ”
Spring 4
“	“Ugh... I have a doctor's appointment later.”
“	“I'm just here for my annual check-up! Don't worry, I'm not preg... I mean, I'm not sick! Heh.”
“	“How much longer do you need, doc? I'm hungry.”
Summer
“	“Summer's here. It's not really my favorite season. The air is so muggy I feel like I'm floating in soup.”
“	“My pet guinea pig, David, just hates this hot weather. He's fussy.”
“	“The air is so thick with honey and nectar all summer. I almost feel dizzy.”
“	“Have you decorated your house at all? That's what I'd be doing if I had a house.”
“	“I went to the beach last night, after dark... Sometimes you can see strange lights bobbing over the sea. Or maybe that was just a dream I had... It doesn't feel real anymore.”
“	“If I knew how to use a sword I would be exploring those caves by the mountain lake right now. It's probably nice and cool in there.”
“	“Ew, I hope I don't get a tan this summer.”
“	“I kind of wish I had a cat. Unfortunately, my Dad is allergic to pretty much everything.”
“	“I'm looking forward to fall... the cool mountain breeze, the swirling red petals, the smell of mushrooms... *sigh*”
“	“Do you ever get an urge to go exploring, [Player]?”
“	“I would love to live in an old farmhouse like you. The creak of a floorboard, the slow plumes of dust whispering through the rafters... There's something special about an old building, isn't there?”
“	“You're an interesting [guy/lady], [Player]. I'm glad you moved here.”
6+ Hearts
“	“I'm actually enjoying myself this summer. It's funny how quickly one's outlook can change.”
8+ Hearts
“	“I used to think Pelican Town was kinda drab, but lately I'm starting to love some things about it.”
Fall
“	“Ah... Fall's here! I was getting so tired of summer.”
“	“I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air today.”
“	“I try to help out in the shop on most days. Business has been pretty bad since the Joja Mart opened, though.”
“	“I can't wait to see some pumpkins this year. The spirit's eve festival happens at the end of the season. It's pretty low-key compared to what you'd see in Zuzu City, but for a small town like this it's a lot of fun.”
“	“Last night, I dreamt that my left hand had turned into a gigantic [random object]... Does that mean anything?”
“	“Do you have any scarecrows on your farm?”
“	“Are you growing pumpkins on your farm this year? Save one for me!”
“	“I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best. I dunno why I'm saying this to you. Don't tell anyone.”
If Joja has closed:
“	“Ever since Joja Mart shut down we've been doing great at the shop!”
If Community Center is restored:
“	“I can't believe you fixed up that old Community Center all by yourself. I'm really impressed.”
6+ Hearts
“	“Hi. Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?”
“	“I wish the season lasted a little longer. When the wind really picks up, I almost feel like a kid again.”
8+ Hearts
“	“You know, I could actually see myself becoming a farmer some day... But how would that ever happen? *chuckle*”
Winter
“	“Well, fall is over... But I like winter, too!”
“	“It's just too cold to go outside much. But I do enjoy building a snowgoon.”
“	“Doesn't a steaming hot cup of cocoa sound good right now?”
“	“Hi. Is it boring to be a farmer during the winter?”
“	“It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year.”
“	“Another year is almost over. It goes by so fast, doesn't it?”
“	“One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different.”
“	“It's the weekend! That means I can play twice as many video games. Bye.”
“	“Hi. If you're ever bored, you can always hang out in my room. As long as I'm not changing, of course!”
“	“It's so cold, I wish we had a hot cup of cocoa to share.”
6+ Hearts
“	“I've been daydreaming a lot lately... Oh! You want to know what it's about? Well... ...It's a secret.”
“	“It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year. And that means you can hang out with me more often!”

Years 2+
“	“Have you seen all the crazy trees around town? Everything looks so different... I feel like we're in a fairy world.”
Green rain finished (next day)
“	“And just like that, everything's back to normal. It's like magic!”
At Ginger Island
“	“I hope a mermaid visits the beach.”
“	“Bummer... Willy says we have to stay on the beach... And I brought my sword and everything...”
“	“The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!”
“	“Hmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island? Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways.”
“	“My skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while. I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy.”
“	“Hey [Player], want to build a sand castle with me? Actually, a sand dungeon might be cooler!”
“	“Hey [Player], you think you could build a raft? I saw a few cool islands on the way here I want to visit.”
“	“An island this big has got to be hiding some buried treasure. Quick, get me a shovel! Relax, I'm just kidding.”
“	“Gus made me a dark purple refresher, to match my hair. It tastes great!”
“	“I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back.”
“	“Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back.”
Dating / 10 Hearts
“	“Hi. Do you feel like everything seems unreal lately? Not in a bad way, though.”
“	“I usually feel lonely this time of year, but not anymore. [Player], what are your plans for the future?”
“	“[Player], there's something I want to tell you...
It's just... um... well... your boots! They, uh...look really clean... *gulp* That's all... *sigh*”

“	“Another year is almost over... But this was a really good year, don't you think?”
“	“Wow, you look nice today. I mean, that summer air is really good for the complexion, isn't it?... heh...”
“	“Do you ever get lonely on your farm?”
“	“I had an interesting dream last night, with you in it. It was a good dream.”
When engaged
“	“Hehe. Me? Married? I never thought this would happen. We're going to have a lot of fun together.”
“	“I'm engaged to a farmer. Wow! Our lives are going to be a lot different from now on.”
If the player starts dating Sebastian
“	“I heard you and Sebastian started dating... I didn't realize you guys had a thing...”
If the player marries Sebastian
“	“Congratulations on the marriage. I guess that means Sebastian won't be moving to the city like he always talked about.”
“	“That'll be nice. I'd be kind of sad if I never saw him again. We've always been good friends.”
After Group 10 Heart Event
“	“Don't talk to me!”
“	“*sigh*... I can't stay mad at you anymore, [Player]. Let's just move on with our lives.”
